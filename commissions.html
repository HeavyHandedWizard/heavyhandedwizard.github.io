            <div class="text-container text-softer">
                <p class="text-brighter">Thank you for your interest in commissioning me!! :D</p>
                <p class="text-brighter">Even if you aren&#39;t interested in a commission, sharing this page, graphic and/or my Ko-fi page is highly appreciated!!</p>
                <h2 class="text-brighter">Terms of Service</h2>
                <p>
                    Before purchasing a commission, please provide me with either a visual character reference or a detailed written description of 
                    the character you'd like drawn. I am also open to designing characters, but this may cost extra. Commissions are available in 
                    digital or traditional mediums; please let me know if you have a preference!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I anticipate the turnaround time to be around 1-4 weeks depending on my workload and the commission's complexity. This time frame 
                    may also be affected by how quickly the client is able to communicate with me regarding commission details. I can provide a more 
                    accurate time estimate at the time of commissioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I accept payments in USD via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/heavyhandedwizard/commissions" target="_blank">Ko-fi</a>. I can either 
                    accept 100% of the payment upfront, or 50% upfront and 50% before completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will send visual updates upon completing each stage of the artistic process (sketch, lineart, flat color, rendered) for the 
                    client's approval. You can then request any revisions you'd like for that stage. Small changes are free, but large changes may 
                    incur additional costs. Once you approve a stage, I will begin working on the next one. If you change your mind and decide you 
                    would like a revision after previous approval, this will also cost extra. Please note that when choosing to pay 50% upfront and 
                    50% before completion, progress updates may be watermarked.
                </p>
                <p>

                    commission progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will not offer refunds for completed commissions. However, I may offer refunds for commissions that have not been started, 
                    or partial refunds for commissions that are in progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I reserve the right to use and share the commissioned work, which may include posting it on social media and in my portfolio. If you would 
                    not like the commissioned work to be shared publicly, please let me know beforehand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can provide a Nightshade protected version of a completed commission upon request.

                <p>
                    Please note that the commission prices listed are adapted for a Personal Use license. A Personal Use license allows you to post 
                    or share the art however you like, as long as credit to the artist (HeavyHandedWizard) with a link to this website is provided, and 
                    my signature remains intact. A Personal Use license does not allow you to sell the commissioned art, such as on merchandise. If you would 
                    like a commercial license, please contact me! I can offer a free quote for any commission. Commissioned work may not be used for NFTs or 
                    to train AI under any license.
